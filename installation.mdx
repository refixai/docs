<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your domain">
    To get started, go to app.refix.ai and create an account. Once you have your account setup, you will see a dialog asking you to add a domain.

      <img src="/images/onboarding-popup.png" />
    </Frame>

    Go ahead and add the domain name of the website you want to run refix on, without the protocol.
     For example - `yourwebsite.com`

     <Info>
       Subdomains (`test.com` and `xyz.test.com`) are considered as separate entities and will count in your site allowance. Checkout how many domains are allowed in each plan [here](https://refix.ai/#pricing)
     </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the javascript snippet">
    Once you have registered the domain, you will see a code snippet. Copy the snippet then add it within the `<head>` tags at the base of your product - ideally right before the closing `</head>` tag. This ensures Refix loads on any page users visit.

    Once this is done, and live on your production environment, Refix will automatically detect the installation and start tracking your website
