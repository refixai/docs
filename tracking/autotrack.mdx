Once refix is up and running, it will automatically start capturing every Interactions done on your website.
This section introduces the core principles of what Refix tracks, how it does it and what it means.

There are 3 core entities in the heart of Refix

1. Users
2. Sessions
3. Interactions

<br/>

<Info>
    All these entities are tied to a domain. This means that as of now, if you
    have multiple domains added, data is not shared across them
