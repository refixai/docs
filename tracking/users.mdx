Whenever a new or repeat visitor lands on your website, Refix captures the essential user details like the `Browser`, `Country`, `Device type`, `Operating system`, `Language`, and `Screen resolution`.
You can gain deep insights into your audience composition and how it changes over time from the Dashboard.

Refix is built with user privacy and data security as top priorities. We do not use third party cookies or track any sensitive data (like password inputs, IP addresses etc) that might be a security concern for your visitors

The Users tracked by Refix  can be linked to your application users via our `identifyUsers` SDK
