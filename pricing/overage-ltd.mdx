title: Overage Pricing for Lifetime Deal Users
---
Thank you for being a valued Lifetime Deal user! We're excited to support your growing business needs. Below you'll find information about our pricing structure for events beyond your initial LTD allocation.

## Base LTD Package

As an LTD user, you receive:

- Up to 500,000 events per month
- Unlimited Domains
- Visual Labelling Mode
- Early Access to Funnels 

## Overage Pricing

If you exceed your 500,000 monthly events, the following tiered pricing applies:

| Additional Events  Tier | Monthly Price | 
|------------------------|---------------:|
| Up to 100,000 | $10 | 
| 100,001 to 500,000 | $25 | 
| 500,001 to 1,000,000 | $40 | 
| 1,000,001 to 2,000,000 | $60 | 
| 2,000,001 to 3,000,000 | $75 | 
| 3,000,001 to 4,000,000 | $90 | 
| 4,000,001 to 5,000,000 | $100 | 
| 5,000,001 to 8,000,000 | $125 | 
| 8,000,001 or more | [Contact us](mailto:hey@refix.ai) | 

### How It Works

1. Your first 500,000 events are always included in your LTD.
2. If you exceed 500,000 events, you'll be charged based on the tier your usage falls into.

### Example

If you use 750,000 events in a month:
- First 500,000: Covered by your LTD
- Next 250,000: Falls into the "100,001 to 500,000 " tier
  - Total overage charge: $25

## Billing and Usage Tracking

- Overage charges are billed at the end of your billing cycles.
- You can track your usage in real-time through your account dashboard.
