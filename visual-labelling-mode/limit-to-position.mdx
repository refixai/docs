We understand that web apps are dynamic, and the content of elements on pages can change frequently. This can lead to the creation of new events in Refix, which can be difficult to manage. 
In such cases, Limit to Position comes in handy by allowing you to track events based only on the position of the element on the page.

Here are some common use cases where Limit to Position can be useful
1. A username button on the settings page takes you to the account details page. Since the username will be dynamic, it would be best to track the event based on the position of the button. You would want to track this as a single event, called `Username Clicked`.
2. On an e-commerce site, a "Today's Deal" button in the header shows changing daily offers. Track clicks by the button's position, not its variable text, as a single "Daily Deal Clicked" event.
